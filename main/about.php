                    <p>
                        To promote the traditions preserved by the Catholic Church where:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Catholics can pray for the intercession of saints and blesseds
                        in the name of the Lord, for He made them holy and allowed them 
                        to deliver His messages and miracles. To pray with them, they need 
                        depictions of them where the iconographic elements of each determine 
                        the type of help they can offer as they intercede. They know that 
                        only God, through His power, made their intercession possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Catholics can also build their lives by being inspired from saints
                        and blesseds, whether it is about martyrdom, charity, defense of faith, 
                        or leadership. They shall be encouraged to honor their lives during
                        their feast days, where devotion is the central part, along with
                        venerating the relics or statues of them to either ask for blessings
                        or healing. The memorials of those holy souls are His instruments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        - Catholics can at least pray for the intercession of the Mother
                        of God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, via the rosary, to start their 
                        journey as practicing individuals. They must witness the Lord's 
                        sacrifice in at least every Sunday Mass via the crucifix, honor 
                        His mother's intercession by wearing scapulars, and extend their
                        prayers to the Lord and His mother by earning specific novenas.
                    </p>

                        We visualize a future of the Catholic Church where later generations
                        of youths still embrace the depth of its preserved traditions that 
                        helped on strengthening their Catholic faith as a result of the
                        earlier generations who promoted and passed them down, regardless
                        of hostilities in the modern world, whether they are about human
                        rights, technology, or even conflicts in doctrine and theology.

                        portraits, statues, or fundamental accessories, as long as they 
                        are still ready to preserve the traditions of the Catholic Church, 
                        as they are all inspired by the messages brought by Scripture, whether 
                        literal or implied, all while living in the modern world.
